{"id":"butteredrum","parent":"heucherella","name":"Buttered Rum","longName":"heucherella Buttered Rum","description":"\"Caramel-dipped, deeply-cut maple leaves adorn this aptly named plant from spring to summer. In fall, the cool weather burnishes the leaves to a lovely rose red - a perfect complement to fall-planted containers. Grows into a medium sized mound that's perfect in the landscape. Try it in a vertical planting with contrasting purple-leaved varieties of Heuchera.\"","thumbnail":"images/ggn/thumbnail/Heucherella_Buttered_Rum_1.jpg","images":["images/ggn/large/Heucherella_Buttered_Rum_1b.jpg","images/ggn/large/Heucherella_Buttered_Rum_2b.jpg","images/ggn/large/Heucherella_Buttered_Rum_3b.jpg","images/ggn/large/Heucherella_Buttered_Rum_4b.jpg","images/ggn/large/Heucherella_Buttered_Rum_5b.jpg","images/ggn/large/Heucherella_Buttered_Rum_6b.jpg","images/ggn/large/Heucherella_Buttered_Rum_7b.jpg","images/ggn/large/Heucherella_Buttered_Rum_8b.jpg"],"price":"","unit":"","soil":"","growthRate":"Fast","growingSeason":"Spring","floweringSeason":"Spring","bloomTime":"June,July","comments":"","children":[]}
