In fall, the cool weather burnishes the leaves to a lovely rose red - a perfect complement to fall-planted containers. Grows into a medium sized mound that's perfect in the landscape. Try it in a vertical planting with contrasting purple-leaved varieties of Heuchera.\"","thumbnail":"","image1":"","image2":"","image3":"","price":"","unit":"","soil":"","growthRate":"Fast","growingSeason":"Spring","floweringSeason":"Spring","bloomTime":"June,July","comments":"","children":[]}
