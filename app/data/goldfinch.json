{"id":"goldfinch","parent":"leucanthemum","name":"Goldfinch","longName":"leucanthemum Goldfinch","description":"\"This is the yellowest flowering Shasta daisy ever! Long blooming and compact with semi-double flowers. 'Goldfinch' is the product of years of breeding for yellow flowers. All other \"yellow\" Leucanthemum pale in comparison! Charming semi-double flowers, very slowly and gracefully change from bright lemon yellow to an ivory white. A real gem, amongst the bland Leucanthemum offerings.\"","thumbnail":"","images":["images/ggn/large/Leucanthemum_Goldfinch_1b.jpg","images/ggn/large/Leucanthemum_Goldfinch_2b.jpg","images/ggn/large/Leucanthemum_Goldfinch_3b.jpg","images/ggn/large/Leucanthemum_Goldfinch_4b.jpg","images/ggn/large/Leucanthemum_Goldfinch_5b.jpg","images/ggn/large/Leucanthemum_Goldfinch_6b.jpg","images/ggn/large/Leucanthemum_Goldfinch_7b.jpg","images/ggn/large/Leucanthemum_Goldfinch_8b.jpg","images/ggn/large/Leucanthemum_Goldfinch_9b.jpg"],"price":"","unit":"","soil":"","growthRate":"","growingSeason":"","floweringSeason":"","bloomTime":"","comments":"Fast","children":[]}
