Long blooming and compact with semi-double flowers. 'Goldfinch' is the product of years of breeding for yellow flowers. All other \"yellow\" Leucanthemum pale in comparison! Charming semi-double flowers, very slowly and gracefully change from bright lemon yellow to an ivory white. A real gem, amongst the bland Leucanthemum offerings.\"","thumbnail":"images/ggn/thumbnail/Leucanthemum_Goldfinch_1.jpg","images":["images/ggn/large/Leucanthemum_Goldfinch_1b.jpg","images/ggn/large/Leucanthemum_Goldfinch_2b.jpg","images/ggn/large/Leucanthemum_Goldfinch_3b.jpg","images/ggn/large/Leucanthemum_Goldfinch_4b.jpg","images/ggn/large/Leucanthemum_Goldfinch_5b.jpg","images/ggn/large/Leucanthemum_Goldfinch_6b.jpg","images/ggn/large/Leucanthemum_Goldfinch_7b.jpg","images/ggn/large/Leucanthemum_Goldfinch_8b.jpg","images/ggn/large/Leucanthemum_Goldfinch_9b.jpg"],"price":"","unit":"","soil":"","growthRate":"Fast","growingSeason":"Spring","floweringSeason":"Summer","bloomTime":"June,July,August","comments":"","children":[]}
