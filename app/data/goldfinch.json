{"id":"goldfinch","name":"Goldfinch","longName":"leucanthemum Goldfinch","description":"\"This is the yellowest flowering Shasta daisy ever! Long blooming and compact with semi-double flowers. 'Goldfinch' is the product of years of breeding for yellow flowers. All other \"yellow\" Leucanthemum pale in comparison! Charming semi-double flowers, very slowly and gracefully change from bright lemon yellow to an ivory white. A real gem, amongst the bland Leucanthemum offerings.\"","thumbnail":"","image1":"","image2":"","image3":"","price":"","unit":"","soil":"","growthRate":"Fast","growingSeason":"Spring","floweringSeason":"Summer","bloomTime":"June,July,August","comments":"","children":[]}
