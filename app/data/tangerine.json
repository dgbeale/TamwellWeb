{"id":"tangerine","parent":"echinacea","name":"Tangerine Dream","longName":"echinacea Tangerine Dream","description":"\"Everything a great garden plant should be. Elegant 4\" clear orange flowers have wide, overlapping petals. The bloom color holds better than any we have ever seen and the flowers have a lovely honey-scent. This is in our landscape series due to its size and multiple, wide-branching strong stems. Super for the sunny landscape, in mass or in a mixed planting. Great for cutting. Received the highest rating at MSU for container culture.\"","thumbnail":"","images":["images/ggn/large/Echinacea_Tangerine_Dream_1b.jpg","images/ggn/large/Echinacea_Tangerine_Dream_2b.jpg"],"price":"","unit":"","soil":"","growthRate":"","growingSeason":"","floweringSeason":"","bloomTime":"","comments":"Fast","children":[]}
