Elegant 4\" clear orange flowers have wide, overlapping petals. The bloom color holds better than any we have ever seen and the flowers have a lovely honey-scent. This is in our landscape series due to its size and multiple, wide-branching strong stems. Super for the sunny landscape, in mass or in a mixed planting. Great for cutting. Received the highest rating at MSU for container culture.\"","thumbnail":"images/ggn/thumbnail/Echinacea_Tangerine_Dream_1.jpg","images":["images/ggn/large/Echinacea_Tangerine_Dream_1b.jpg","images/ggn/large/Echinacea_Tangerine_Dream_2b.jpg"],"price":"","unit":"","soil":"","growthRate":"Fast","growingSeason":"Spring","floweringSeason":"Summer","bloomTime":"July,August,September","comments":"","children":[]}
