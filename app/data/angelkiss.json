{"id":"angelkiss","parent":"bergenia","name":"Dragonfly Angel Kiss","longName":"bergenia Dragonfly Angel Kiss","description":"\"Soft, sweet, semi-double, white to light pink flowers in great abundance give value to an old garden favorite. A perfect companion to 'Pink Dragonfly'. DRAGONFLY? 'Angel Kiss' is just as easy to grow, and really lights up an early spring garden with grace and sophistication. Winter foliage is a very dark wine-red. In early spring, it's the perfect contrasting foil for the charming flowers that emerge snow white and then take on a light pink glow. Very choice, very easy.","thumbnail":"","images":[],"price":"","unit":"","soil":"","growthRate":"Moderate","growingSeason":"Spring","floweringSeason":"Spring","bloomTime":"March,April","comments":"\"An easy, low maintenance plant.\"","children":[]}
