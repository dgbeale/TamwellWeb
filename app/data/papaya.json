'Papaya Popsicle' is an all-summer bloomer which has a very short compact habit. A prolific bloomer with spikes of flowers the color of ripe papayas. Charming, grass-like foliage looks neat all summer! Great for small gardens or in a container. Loved by hummingbirds!\"","thumbnail":"","images":["images/ggn/large/Kniphofia_Papaya_Popsicle_1b.jpg","images/ggn/large/Kniphofia_Papaya_Popsicle_2b.jpg","images/ggn/large/Kniphofia_Papaya_Popsicle_3b.jpg","images/ggn/large/Kniphofia_Papaya_Popsicle_4b.jpg"],"price":"","unit":"","soil":"","growthRate":"","growingSeason":"","floweringSeason":"","bloomTime":"","comments":"Fast","children":[]}
