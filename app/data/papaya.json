A prolific bloomer with spikes of flowers the color of ripe papayas. Charming, grass-like foliage looks neat all summer! Great for small gardens or in a container. Loved by hummingbirds!\"","thumbnail":"","image1":"","image2":"","image3":"","price":"","unit":"","soil":"","growthRate":"Fast","growingSeason":"Spring","floweringSeason":"Spring,Summer,Fall","bloomTime":"June,July,August,September,October","comments":"","children":[]}
