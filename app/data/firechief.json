{"id":"firechief","name":"Fire Chief","longName":"heuchera Fire Chief","description":"\"Mid-sized leaves of glowing wine red make a gorgeous medium sized mound. These are topped with bicolored pink and white flowers on dark red stems. Foliage turns a little browner in the winter, but otherwise holds its wine red color. Blooms continuously spring, summer, and fall like H. 'Paris'. You'll need to call the Fire Chief when you see this one!\"","thumbnail":"","image1":"","image2":"","image3":"","price":"","unit":"","soil":"","growthRate":"Fast","growingSeason":"Spring","floweringSeason":"Spring,Summer,Fall","bloomTime":"June,July,August,September","comments":"\"Be careful not to bury the crowns when planting.
