Compared to 'Husker's Red', this beauty has much darker foliage which stays darker. Dale Lindgren of University of Nebraska created this dark leaf ultra-hardy, pink flowering form. A tough, carefree plant which tolerates high heat and humidity. A perfect dark background plant for the border.\n\"","thumbnail":"","images":[],"price":"","unit":"","soil":"","growthRate":"Fast","growingSeason":"Spring","floweringSeason":"Summer","bloomTime":"July,August","comments":"\"Easy to grow.
