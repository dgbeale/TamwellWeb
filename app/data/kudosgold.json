Series - gold flowers in large compact spikes. The plants start blooming in late May and continue through the season. If they start looking a little tired, just shear them back and they will keep on blooming. Great form and longevity!\"","thumbnail":"","images":["images/ggn/large/Agastache_Kudos_Gold_1b.jpg","images/ggn/large/Agastache_Kudos_Gold_2b.jpg"],"price":"","unit":"","soil":"","growthRate":"","growingSeason":"","floweringSeason":"","bloomTime":"","comments":"Fast","children":[]}
